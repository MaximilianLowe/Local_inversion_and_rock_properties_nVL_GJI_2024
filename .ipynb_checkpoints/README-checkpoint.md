# Mesa_Range_magnetic_inversion

This GitHub repository contains the python code to prepare and evaluate the Mensa Range magnetic inversion to recover susceptibility distribution. As well as the jupyter notebook to illustrate the petrological catalogue from nothern Victoria Land and the the jupyter notebook to compare the petrological catalogue to the regional Variation of Information joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin.
